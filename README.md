Steps to run project locally

1. Once you clone the project, get into the project directory and run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
2. Once the dependencies have been installed, please run 'npm run dev' to launch the project locally.
3. It will run on port 5173 by default. The UI is self explanatory in terms of adding, 'Mark as complete' and deleting data. You can update the Todo text and description by just clicking on it.

I have setup some mock data by default from our side, so you can update/delete it as you like.
